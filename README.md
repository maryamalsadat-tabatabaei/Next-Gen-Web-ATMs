## Features

- `XState`:
XState is a powerful library that allows for creating, interpreting, and executing finite state machines and statecharts. It is used in this implementation to manage complex application state and provide smooth transitions between different states.

- `React`:
React is the core framework used for building the Next-Gen Web ATMs front-end. It enables the creation of reusable UI components, efficient rendering, and seamless integration with other libraries and tools.

- `Material-UI`:
Material-UI is a popular UI component library that provides pre-styled components for tables, steppers, icons, buttons, forms, and more. It helps in achieving a consistent and visually appealing user interface.

- `Webpack`:
Webpack is a module bundler used to configure the React application. It optimizes the delivery of files, allows for code splitting, and handles assets like CSS, images, and fonts. With webpack, the application can achieve faster loading times and better performance.

- `Jest`:
Jest is a testing framework used for unit testing the React components in the application. It provides a robust and developer-friendly environment for writing tests, tracking code coverage, and ensuring the reliability and correctness of the front-end codebase.

- `Browserslist`:
Browserslist is used to define the supported browser versions for the application. It ensures cross-browser compatibility by automatically adding the necessary vendor prefixes and polyfills to the generated CSS and JavaScript code.

- `i18next`:
i18next is a comprehensive internationalization (i18n) library used to provide localization support in the application. It allows for managing multiple dictionaries, language detection, and seamless translation integration.

- `React Router`:
React Router is a routing library used to handle client-side routing in a single-page application (SPA). It enables navigation between different steps and pages within the application, providing a smooth and intuitive user experience.

- `Workbox`:
Workbox is a set of libraries used for implementing caching and offline capabilities using service workers. It enhances the performance of the web application by caching static assets, API responses, and other resources. Workbox-Core specifically provides core functionalities for managing service workers and caching strategies.

- `WebSocket`:
Implemented for real-time communication between the client-side and the server, enabling instant and efficient data exchange. The application utilized WebSockets to receive events and messages (e.g., Pinkeypressed, CardInsert) and to send messages (e.g., PrintReceipt, cashWithdrawal).


## Conclusion
The Next-Gen Web ATMs front-end implementation combines cutting-edge technologies, best practices, and optimized development processes to provide an efficient and user-friendly banking experience for 3 million users. By utilizing XState, React, Material-UI, and other libraries, the application delivers highly interactive features, responsive design, and seamless navigation. The integration of i18next enables localization support, while Workbox enhances performance and offline capabilities. With a focus on agile development, code quality, and collaboration, the Next-Gen Web ATMs implementation sets a solid foundation for a scalable and robust front-end solution.
